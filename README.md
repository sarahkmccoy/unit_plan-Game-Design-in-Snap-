# Game Design in Snap!
by SARAH MCCOY

-----

### General Overview

This unit would break down the elements of video game design into individual coding lessons and challenges, culminating in bringing together a few of those elements into a unique video game.  It could fit into an intro CS course like TEALS, or be a supplementary unit in BJC's AP CSP curriculum

### Motivation for Unit

Last year I informally (winging it) did a game design unit as I struggled to engage a group of students who had been placed in AP CSP without necessarily choosing it.  I used the "Games for Change" challenge and their intro lessons as a motivation.  The students really enjoyed making their own game, and is probably their main memory and take away from the course.  I would like to develop a better organized unit that is aligned with NY State and AP CSP standards.

### Standards Referenced

9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.
9-12.CT.9 Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
9-12.CT.10 Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

### Lessons
Total length: 2-3 Weeks

Folder with all lessons in google doc form:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-l9-JdSxMRznfCPocolEh-w9p44me85p?usp=sharing

1. Exploring the elements of video game (1 day)
2. Code a simple game (Star Hunter) to see how some basic interactions are created (2 days).  Explain the code, test and debug.
3. Mouse control, using a score variable, and 3 different jumping mechanics.  Create a very simple game.  Explain, test, debug. (2 days)
4. Shooting mechanics and creating and ending a very simple game.  Explain, test, debug. (2 days)
5. Hitting Mechanics with two players. Prompt for and use names (user input).  Complete a simple game script incorporating multiple movements options.(1 day)
6. Maze mechanics and using a timer. (1 day)
7. Project/Assessment:  Code your own video game!  (3-5 days)

### Assessments
1. Each day has a google doc with questions for the students to answer, and coding exercises in most cases
2. The final assessment is for them to create their own video game.
