# Game Design in Snap!
by SARAH MCCOY

-----

### General Overview

This unit would break down the elements of video game design into individual coding lessons and challenges, culminating in bringing together a few of those elements into a unique video game.  It could fit into an intro CS course like TEALS, or be a supplementary unit in BJC's AP CSP curriculum

### Motivation for Unit

Last year I informally (winging it) did a game designe unit as I struggled to engage a group of students who had been placed in AP CSP without necessarily choosing it.  I used the "Games for Change" challenge and their intro lessons as a motivation.  The students really enjoyed making their own game, and is probably their main memory and take away from the course.  I would like to develop a better organized unit that is aligned with NY State and AP CSP standards.
